                <h2>Best things to do in the Lake District</h2>
                <p><b>1 – HIKE IN THE HIGH FELLS</b><br><br>
                    T–here is no better way to see the Lake District than on foot. There are hundreds of paths to explore from gentle strolls around glistening lakes to challenging hikes in the high fells. Some paths cut across rolling meadows and are easy to follow, others disappear along narrow ledges and into rocky crevasses.
                    
                    But fortunately, there is a walk to suit all tastes. If you are after an easy stroll, try the loop around Buttermere. For a slightly harder walk ascend to the summit of Loughrigg for stunning views. Finally, if you like to put in some work, take the hike to the top of Scafell Pike via the Corridor Route.
                    
                    We haven’t quite hiked every trail yet, but we have walked lots of them.  Find all our favourites, covering all difficulty levels, in our guide to the 15 Best Walks in the Lake District.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>2 – EXPLORE A LAKELAND VILLAGE</b><br><br>
                    The villages of the Lake District are built in the regions green-black slate. With a more austere look than the honey-coloured villages of the Cotswolds, they fit more snugly into the rugged scenery, making them some of the best places to visit in the Lake District.

                    Cartmel, on the southern edge of the fells, has become a foodie destination. Chef Simon Rogan has set up shop here, and the village’s eight hundred-year-old priory peers over tiny laneways packed with artisanal goodies. For a splurge head to L’Enclume, his two-star Michelin masterpiece. For the more budget option (slightly) try Rogan & Co. Cartmel’s most important contribution, however, has been the creation of the sticky toffee pudding – pick up a take-home sample at the cute local store.   

                    Hawkshead is another charming village. Head up to the churchyard to enjoy views of the surrounding countryside, then explore the main square. Pick up cool foodstuffs at the Honeypot, try one of the 20 flavours from The Little Ice Cream Shop, or sip the pick of local ales at the KITTchEN.

                    For a quaint village wedged in the hills, head to Grasmere. Towering crags rise all around the town, creating a charming cosy village nestled in beautiful mountain scenery.
